# Vacuum Magnetic Field Solver

This project implements the winding surface method of [1] for computing a sheet current that minimizes the squared flux on some surface, 

                        min int_S (B * n)^2 dA.

The problem is posed as a *linear* least squares problem,

                        min_w |Hw - y|^2 + lambda * |w|^2,

which can be solved rapidly. The magnetic field generated by the (optimized) sheet current satisfies

                        curl(B) = 0 inside S,
                         div(B) = 0 inside S,
                          B * n ~ 0 on S.
The combination of the speed and robustness makes this an ideal method for finding vacuum magnetic fields tangent to a boundary.
